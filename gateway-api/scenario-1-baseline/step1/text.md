# Step 1 — Explore the environment

The Kubernetes cluster is up and the bookstore API is already deployed. Before installing anything, take a moment to understand what's running.

## Check the cluster

```
kubectl get nodes
```{{copy}}

You should see a single node in `Ready` state.

## Inspect the bookstore namespace

```
kubectl get all -n bookstore
```{{copy}}

You'll see:
- **Deployment** `bookstore` (v1) — 2 replicas
- **Deployment** `bookstore-v2` — 1 replica (used later for canary routing)
- **Service** `bookstore` and `bookstore-v2` — ClusterIP on port 80

## Reach the app directly

The app is running but not yet exposed outside the cluster. Port-forward the Service to localhost and curl it from the node:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n bookstore svc/bookstore 8000:80 &
sleep 1
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health
```{{copy}}

Expected output:
```json
{"status":"healthy","version":"v1"}
```

## Explore the API

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/books
```{{copy}}

You'll get a JSON list of books. This is what you'll route externally via ingress-nginx and later via the Gateway API.

## Note on exposed ports

Throughout this scenario two NodePorts are used:

| Controller | HTTP port | HTTPS port |
|---|---|---|
| ingress-nginx | **30080** | 30443 |
| Traefik | **30090** | **30091** |

KillerCoda's **Traffic** tab can proxy to these ports so you can test from your browser.

Click **Check** to verify the bookstore pods are running.
